\chapter{Formulating Language Models as Weighted Sums}
\label{ch:weightedsum}

In this chapter we will present our way to represent the probabilities
$\ProbMKN{w_n}{w_1^{n-1}}$ and $\ProbGLM{w_n}{w_1^{n-1}}$ as weighted sums of
terms depending on $w_n$ for a fixed history $h = w_1^{n-1}$ and an  arbitrary
probability event $w = w_n$.
In other words we will express the formulas given in \cref{ch:review} as
equations of the following form:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:weightedsum}
  \Prob{w}{h} = \sum_{i = 1}^{N} \SumWeight_i^h \cdot \SumArg_i^h(w_n)
\end{equation}

To the authors knowledge, there is no other work on expressing language models
as weighted sums.
However, \textcite{JelinekMercer1980} already experimented with trying to learn
weighted sum parameters automatically for language modeling.

Being able to accurately represent probabilities in a form like this is highly
beneficial for word prediction.
As we can see in \cref{eq:prefixquery} the computation for next word prediction
is based on calculating multiple probabilities $\Prob{w}{h}$ with a fixed
history $h$ but varying arguments $w$.
As has been specified in \cref{ch:review} probability calculation is based on
complex recursive formulas.
Using our weighted sum representation this computation can be speed up by
a huge factor since computation of the sum weights $\SumWeight^h_i$ can
be performed once beforehand.
For each final probability we then only have to perform the $N$ remaining
lookups $\SumArg^h_i(w)$ that actually depend on $w$.

Another handy benefit is that by this representation we have all terms that
change with $w$ explicitly available, which is a prerequisite for top-$k$
joining and will be explained in \cref{ch:topkjoin}.
Lastly our algorithms for calculating sum weights turn out to be performing
faster
then the direct recursive implementations.
We will measure that effect in \cref{sec:evaluation-probability}.

We will now present the basic idea of how to transform $\Prob{w_n}{w_1^{n-1}}$
into weighted sums, that applies to both Modified Kneser-Ney Smoothing and
the Generalized Language Model:

Note that in all \cref{eq:mkn-high,eq:mkn-low,eq:glm-high,eq:glm-low} the
probability event $w_n$ only appears in the nominator of fractions, specifically
in the argument terms of $\DiscountedCount$ or $\DiscountedCount*$.
Additionally $w_n$ occurs as arguments for $\Count$ and $\ContCountIp$ in the
lowest order \cref{eq:mkn-lowest,eq:glm-lowest}.
Our general idea is thus, to first expand recursive calls to
$\Prob(\DummyArg)$ or $\Prob*(\DummyArg)$, and second to factor
out those terms that do not depend on $w_n$ by the distributive property.

\Cref{sec:weightedsum-mkn} discusses our aprroach for Modified Kneser-Ney
smoothing, while \cref{sec:weightedsum-glm} deals with the Generalized
Language Model.

\section{Modified Kneser-Ney Smoothing}
\label{sec:weightedsum-mkn}

Modified Kneser-Ney Smoothed probabilities $\ProbMKN{w}{h}$ are calculated as
follows:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Backing-off: Leave out words at the beginning of the history $h$, until
    $h \Skp$ is seen for the first time (\cref{eq:mkn-backoff}).
  \item Highest order: Take frequency counts $\DiscountedCount(h \: w)$ and
    $\Count(h \Skp)$ (\cref{eq:mkn-high}) and shorten the history by one word.
  \item Lower orders: Take continuation counts $\DiscountedCount*(\WSkp h \: w)$
    and $\ContCountIp(\WSkp h \WSkp)$ (\cref{eq:mkn-low}) and shorten the
    history further until it is empty.
  \item Lowest order: Take continuation counts $\ContCountIp(\WSkp w)$ and
    $\ContCountIp(\WSkp \WSkp)$ (\cref{eq:mkn-lowest}).
\end{enumerate}

\newcommand{\ProbMKNcab}[1]
  {\frac{\DiscountedCount(w_1 w_2 w_3) + \gamma(w_1 w_2) #1}{\Count(w_1 w_2 \Skp)}}
\newcommand{\ProbMKNcb}[1]
  {\frac{\DiscountedCount*(\WSkp w_2 w_3) + \gamma(w_2) #1}{\ContCountIp(\WSkp w_2 \WSkp)}}

\subsection{Example}

As an example we will give the full formula expansion necessary to calculate
$\ProbMKN{w_3}{w_1 w_2}$ for any sequence $w_1 w_2 w_3$, assuming sequence
$w_1 w_2 \Skp$ was seen:
\begin{subequations}
  \begin{align}
    \ProbMKN {w_3}{w_1 w_2} &= \ProbMKNcab{\ProbMKN*{w_3}{w_2}} \\
    \ProbMKN*{w_3}{w_2}     &= \ProbMKNcb{\ProbMKN*{w_3}} \\
    \ProbMKN*{w_3}          &= \ProbMKNc
  \end{align}
\end{subequations}
Inserting the lower orders results in:
\begin{equation}
  \ProbMKN {w_3}{w_1 w_2} = \ProbMKNcab{\ProbMKNcb{\ProbMKNc}}
\end{equation}
By using the distributive property we obtain:
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:probmknexpansion-final}
  \hspace{-2.5em}\ProbGLM {w_3}{w_1 w_2} = {}
    & & \DiscountedCount (w_1 w_2 w_3)   & \cdot\ \frac{1}{\Count(w_1 w_2 \Skp)} \\
    &+& \DiscountedCount*(\WSkp w_3 w_3) & \cdot\ \frac{\gamma(w_1 w_2)}{\Count(w_1 w_2 \Skp) \ContCountIp(\WSkp w_2 \WSkp)} \nonumber \\
    &+& \ContCountIp(\WSkp w_3)          & \cdot\ \frac{\gamma(w_1 w_2) \: \gamma(w_2)}{\Count(w_1 w_2 \Skp) \ContCountIp(\WSkp w_2 \WSkp) \ContCountIp(\WSkp \WSkp)} \nonumber
\end{align}

In the final equation \cref{eq:probmknexpansion-final} we can clearly see
those terms that do depend on $w$ and those that do not.
Per line the left part of the multiplication dot are the terms $\SumArg^h_i(w)$,
while the terms on the right form the sum weights $\SumWeight^h_i$.

But note that this is only valid if the sequence $w_1 w_2 w_3$ was seen in
the training corpus, that is $\Count(w_1 w_2 w_3) \geq 1$.
If this is not the case, backoff steps have to be performed, and a different
resulting formula is obtained.

\subsection{Sum terms}

All counts except those of the lowest order are discounted using
$\DiscountedCount$ and $\DiscountedCount*$ to interpolate that order with the
following by the weight $\gamma(h)$.
This process of interpolating different orders is visualized in
\cref{fig:history-mkn} for the case of a history of length three.
Building similiar backoff graphs for other history lengths is straightforward.

\begin{figure}[tb]
  \centering
  \input{figures/historiesmkn}
  \caption{
    The \emph{backoff graphs} shows the interpolation of different orders during
    computation of $\ProbMKN{w_4}{w_1 w_2 w_3}$.
    Centered are the histories for each probability.
    It is assumed that the history $w_1 w_2 w_3$ was seen during training, so
    that no backing-off is necessary.
    Orders are combined with with interpolation weights $\gamma(\DummyArg)$.
  }
  \label{fig:history-mkn}
\end{figure}

Each order with a history $h$ is interpolated with the following order where
the first word of $h$ is removed.
Thus a total ordering on the histories of the orders can be specified.
In \cref{fig:history-mkn} we have thus assigned each history a number from
$1$~to~$4$.
Let $\DerivedHistory[i]$ denote the history of that graph with number $i$.

The first step in expressing $\ProbMKN{w}{h}$ as a weighted sum is finding the
number $N$ of sum weights.
In the case of Modified Kneser-Ney Smoothing this is exactly the number of
interpolation orders.
Let $\DerivedHistory[s]$ be the first seen history that is the result of
backing off given history $h$ exaclty $s$ many times.
The number $N$ of sum weights is then the number of words of that history plus
one for the empty history.
\begin{equation}
  N = \NGramLength{\DerivedHistory[s]} + 1
\end{equation}
Where $\NGramLength{w_1^n} = n$ is the length of the $n$-gram $w_1^n$.

The next step is to find the actual terms $\SumArg_i^h(w)$ that shall be
weightedly added.
When looking at the equations that define Modified Kneser-Ney we note the fact
that only the count terms in the numerators depend on the probability event $w$.
Exactly these terms compose our sum arguments:
\begin{equation}
  \SumArg_i^h(w) =
    \begin{dcases*}
      \Count(w)                                             & if $N = 1$ \\
      \DiscountedCount(\DerivedHistory[s] w)                & if $N \neq 1 \land i = 1$ \\
      \DiscountedCount*(\WSkp \DerivedHistory[s + i - 1] w) & if $N \neq 1 \land 1 < i < N$ \\
      \ContCountIp(\WSkp w)                                 & if $N \neq 1 \land i = N$
    \end{dcases*}
\end{equation}

Lastly we need to define the actual sum weights $\SumWeight_i^h$.
We note that --- because each order is interpolated with the weight $\gamma$ of
the previous order --- each order is in total weighted by the product of the
$\gamma$s of all previous orders.
Additionally lower order models occur in the numerators of fractions, because of
that they are weighted by all previous denominator counts as well.
Building on this we can define:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:mkn-sumweight}
  \SumWeight_i^h = \frac{1}{\Count(\DerivedHistory[s] \Skp)} \prod_{j = 2}^i \frac{\gamma(\DerivedHistory[s+i-2])}{\ContCountIp(\WSkp \DerivedHistory[s+i-1] \WSkp)}
\end{equation}

Specifying an algorithm to compute interpolation weights $\SumWeight_i^h$ that
minimizes frequency count lookup (using the iterative definition of
$\SumWeight_i^h$) is straightforward and given in \cref{alg:weightedsum-mkn}.
In \cref{ln:alg-mkn-lowerorders} the lower order sum weights are assigned.
It takes advantage of the fact that \cref{eq:mkn-sumweight} can easily be
written in a recursive manner.
This is done to avoid repeated count lookups and multiplications.

\section{Generalized Language Model}
\label{sec:weightedsum-glm}

The difference between the Modified Kneser-Ney smoothed language model and the
Generalized Language Model is the way in which orders are interpolated.
Instead of just one probability --- that of shortening the history by one ---
being factored in, in the Generalized Language Model the average of multiple
probabilities of the next lower order is factored into the higher order
probability.

This section will not consider the general case were one probability
$\ProbGLM{w}{h}$ incorporates exactly $\NumSkpOp{h}$ probabilities
$\ProbGLM*{w}{\SkpOp[j]{h}}$ of the next lower order.
Instead only the special case described by \textcite{Pickhardt2014}, that is
actually used in practice, is examined.
That is the number of lower order probabilities incorporated $\NumSkpOp{h}$
is set to the number of non-skip words in $h$, and $\SkpOp[j]{h}$ is defined as
replacing the $j$th non-skip word in $h$ with a skip $\Skp$.

\subsection{Example}
\label{subsec:weightedsum-glm-example}

  {\frac{\DiscountedCount(w_1 w_2 w_3) + \frac{\gamma(w_1 w_2)}{2}\left(#1 + #2\right)}{\Count(w_1 w_2 \Skp)}}

\newcommand{\ProbGLMcss}
  {\frac{\ContCountIp(\WSkp \Skp \Skp w_3)}{\ContCountIp(\WSkp \Skp \Skp \WSkp)}}

Examplatory the full formula expansion for $\ProbGLM{w_3}{w_1 w_2}$, assuming
the sequence $w_1 w_2 \Skp$ was seen:
\begin{subequations}
  \begin{align}
    \hspace{-2.5em}\ProbGLM {w_3}{w_1 w_2}   &= \ProbGLMcab{\ProbGLM*{w_3}{\Skp w_2}}{\ProbGLM*{w_3}{w_1 \Skp}} \\
    \hspace{-2.5em}\ProbGLM*{w_3}{\Skp w_2}  &= \ProbGLMcsb{\ProbGLM*{w_3}{\Skp \Skp}} \\
    \hspace{-2.5em}\ProbGLM*{w_3}{w_1 \Skp}  &= \ProbGLMcas{\ProbGLM*{w_3}{\Skp \Skp}} \\
    \hspace{-2.5em}\ProbGLM*{w_3}{\Skp \Skp} &= \ProbGLMcss
  \end{align}
\end{subequations}
After insertion of lower order probabilities:
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:probglmexpansion-inserted}
  \hspace{-2.5em}&\ProbGLM{w_3}{w_1 w_2} =\\
  \hspace{-2.5em}&\qquad \ProbGLMcab{\ProbGLMcsb{\ProbGLMcss}}
                                    {\ProbGLMcas{\ProbGLMcss}} \nonumber
\end{align}
Finally, by using the distributive property, we arrive at the weighted sum
representation: $\SumArg^h_i(w)$ left of the multiplication dot,
$\SumWeight^h_i$ right.
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:probglmexpansion-final}
  \hspace{-2.5em}\ProbGLM {w_3}{w_1 w_2} =

\subsection{Backoff graph}

\Cref{fig:history-glm} shows the \emph{backoff graph} introduced by
\textcite{BilmesKirchhoff2003}.
It visualizes the lower order probabilities that factor into those of higher
orders, using that definition of $\SkpOp[j]{h}$.
The nodes represent the histories $h = w_1 w_2 w_3$ of a probability
$\ProbGLM{w_4}{w_1 w_2 w_3}$.
The directed edges represent an immediate dependency, for example the
probabilities that occur in the definition of
$\ProbGLM*{w_4}{w_1 w_2 \Skp}$ are $\ProbGLM*{w_4}{w_1 \Skp \Skp}$ and
$\ProbGLM*{w_4}{\Skp w_2 \Skp}$.
In order theory, graphs that generalize this idea are also known as
\emph{hasse diagrams}.

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \input{figures/historiesglm}
  \caption{
    Backoff graph of order 3 for history $h = w_1 w_2 w_3$.
  }
  \label{fig:history-glm}
\end{figure}


We also call a graph that represents the inter-dependencies of probabilities
during the calculation of $\ProbGLM{w}{h}$ the \emph{binomial diamond} of order
$n = \NGramLength{h}$, because of its diamond-like shape, and a number of
properties:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item \label{itm:num-layers} Unlike the case of Modified Kneser-Ney Smoothing
    there is no longer one clear way to define a total order of all the
    histories in the graph.
    Instead if we partitioned the graph into layers, where layer $k$ contains
    the histories that have exactly $k$ skip words, the graph has $n + 1$ layers.
  \item \label{itm:num-childs} Layer $k$ contains exactly $\binom{n}{k}$ nodes.
  \item \label{itm:num-edges}  Nodes in layer $k$ have exactly $n - k$ outgoing
    and $k$ incoming edges.
  \item \label{itm:num-nodes}  There are $2^n$ nodes in the graph.
\end{enumerate}

\Cref{itm:num-layers} is due to the fact that layer $k$ includes exactly those
histories that are part of the $k$th highest order of probability.

To explain \cref{itm:num-childs}, it is helpful to imagine replacing words in
a history as laying a mask of either a skip or a non-skip on top of each word.
Then the number of nodes in each layer can be understood as permuting the
skip and non-skip masks on top of the history.
It is a well known fact that there are exactly $\binom{n}{k}$ permutations of
$k$ tokens of type A (skips) and $l$ tokens of type B (non-skips) when
$n = k + l$.

\Cref{itm:num-edges} directly follows from the fact, that each non-skip word
in a history can be replaced by a skip, and that each skip is the result
of those replacements.

Lastly, we can explain \cref{itm:num-nodes} because every history is just the
result of laying a mask that is a combination of skips or non-skips on top of
the original history.
All possible masks are then all permutations of two elements (skips or
non-skips) with repetition of length $n$, which there are $2^n$ arrangements of.
We can also infer this from \cref{itm:num-childs} via the binomial theorem
$(x+ y)^n = \sum_{k=0}^n \binom{n}{k} x^{n-k} y^k$, if we set ${x = y = 1}$,
we obtain $\sum_{k=0}^n \binom{n}{k} = 2^n$.

Following the model of the backoff graph will be a major aid in understanding
the weighted sum representation of the Generalized Language Model.

In order to have a notation avaialbe for all derived histories, we impose an
arbitrary total ordering one those histories.
One such ordering is given in \cref{fig:history-glm} and assigns each history
a number between $1$ and $8$.
Let $\DerivedHistory[i]$ than be the $i$th history of an arbitrary ordering.

\subsection{Number of sum weights}

In the previous subsection, it was reasoned that, in the Generalized Language
Model, for a history of length $n$ there are exactly $2^n$ possible derivative
histories.
Following this, one might make the assumption, that to evaluate $\ProbGLM{w}{h}$
it is necessary to evaluate at most $2^n - 1$  different probabilities
$\ProbGLM*{w}{\partial^* h}$ where $\partial^* h$ is any of the $2^n - 1$
derived histories of $h$ excluding $h$ itself.
This assumption however is wrong as it can be necessary that one history $h^*$
is both part of a highest order probability $\ProbGLM{w}{h^*}$ and a lower order
probability $\ProbGLM*{w}{h^*}$ in the presence of unseen histories, as will
shown in the next paragraph.

\begin{subequations}
  Let us for example calculate the probability $\ProbGLM{w_3}{w_1 w_2}$ on
  hypothetical training data.
  That hypothetical training data shall be different from
  \cref{subsec:weightedsum-glm-example} and now $w_1 w_2$ shall be unseen,
  that is $\Count(w_1 w_2) = 0$.
  Because of this the average of back-off probabilities following
  \cref{eq:glm-backoff} has to be formed:
  \begin{equation}
    \ProbGLM{w_3}{w_1 w_2} = \frac{1}{2} \left( \ProbGLM{w_3}{\Skp w_2} + \ProbGLM{w_3}{w_1 \Skp}\right)
  \end{equation}
  Note that these back-off probabilities for histories $\Skp w_2$ and $w_1 \Skp$
  are still of the highest order $\ProbGLM$.
  We now further assume history $\Skp w_2$ to also not occur in training, so that
  further back-off is necessary.
  History $w_1 \Skp$ however is treated as seen:
  \begin{align}
    \label{eq:glm-example-unseen}
    \ProbGLM{w_3}{\Skp w_2} &= \ProbGLM{w_3}{\Skp \Skp} \\
    \label{eq:glm-example-seen}
    \ProbGLM{w_3}{w_1 \Skp} &= \frac{\Count(w_1 \Skp w_3) + \gamma(w_1 \Skp) \ProbGLM*{w_3}{\Skp \Skp}}
                                    {\Count(w_2 \Skp \Skp)}
  \end{align}
  We can see, that $\ProbGLM{w_3}{\Skp \Skp}$ (\cref{eq:glm-example-unseen}) and
  $\ProbGLM*{w_3}{\Skp \Skp}$ (\cref{eq:glm-example-seen}) both factor into
  probability $\ProbGLM{w_3}{w_1 w_2}$.
  They would be evaluated as:
  \begin{align}
    \ProbGLM {w_3}{\Skp \Skp} &= \frac{\Count(\Skp \Skp w_3)}{\Count(\Skp \Skp \Skp)} \\
    \ProbGLM*{w_3}{\Skp \Skp} &= \frac{\ContCountIp(\WSkp \Skp \Skp w_3)}{\ContCountIp(\WSkp \Skp \Skp \WSkp)}
  \end{align}
\end{subequations}

Because of this, it is possible that one history $\DerivedHistory[\DummyIndex]$
might both occur as highest order probability
$\ProbGLM{w}{\DerivedHistory[\DummyIndex]}$ and lower order probability
$\ProbGLM*{w}{\DerivedHistory[\DummyIndex]}$.
It is non-trivial to decide exactly how many derived histories occur both as
highest and lower order probabilities, and to fit algorithms to this finding.
Consequently we only employ an upper bound of sum weights $N$ and set all
unnecessary sum weights to zero.
An upper bound for the number of sum weights is the number of derived histories
times two, as histories can occur both in highest and lower order probabilities:
\begin{equation}
  N = 2 \cdot 2^\NGramLength{h}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Sum terms}

Based on this we can define the sum terms for $1 \leq i \leq N$.
\begin{subequations}
  \begin{align}
    \label{eq:glmarg-high}
    \SumArg_{2 i - 1}^h(w) &=
      \begin{dcases*}
        \DiscountedCount(\DerivedHistory[i] w)        & if $\NumSkpOp{\DerivedHistory[i]} > 0$ \\
        \Count(\DerivedHistory[i] w)                  & if $\NumSkpOp{\DerivedHistory[i]} = 0$
      \end{dcases*} \\
    \label{eq:glmarg-low}
    \SumArg_{2 i}^h(w) &=
      \begin{dcases*}
        \DiscountedCount*(\WSkp \DerivedHistory[i] w) & if $\NumSkpOp{\DerivedHistory[i]} > 0$ \\
        \ContCountIp(\WSkp \DerivedHistory[i] w)      & if $\NumSkpOp{\DerivedHistory[i]} = 0$
      \end{dcases*}

The terms with an odd index (\cref{eq:glmarg-high}) correspond to
$\DerivedHistory[i]$ occuring as the highest order of probability, the terms
with even index (\cref{eq:glmarg-low}) to lower orders.
The case of $\NumSkpOp{\DerivedHistory[i]} = 0$ occurs when $\DerivedHistory[i]$
consists only of skips, it thus no longer be backoffed, and therefore
presents the unigram case.

Finding the sum weights $\SumWeight^h_i$ is more complex.
We will first discuss weights for $\SumArg^h_{2 i - 1}(w)$, that is for the
terms that compose the highest order.
Our solution is oriented along the backoff graph.
The weight of a history is exactly then zero, if no backoff step of
\cref{eq:glm-backoff} reaches that history.
This occurs if for that history's node all histories of immediate parent nodes
are seen.
Parents of a node $A$ are all nodes $B$ that have a directed edge from $B$ to
$A$.
Conversly this means that the sum weights $\SumWeight^h_{2 i - 1}$ are proportional
to the number of paths from the root note to the current node, for which the
current node's history is seen but the histories of all others nodes in the
path are not.
A path exists to node $A_1$ from node $A_m$, if there is a set of nodes
$\Set{A_1, \ldots, A_m}$ such that it holds for all nodes $A_i$ in that set,
that $A_{i+1}$ is a parent of $A_i$ for $1 \leq i < m$.
% The path to $A_1$ from $A_m$ then consists of all the nodes of that set.

What also has to be considered is that in \cref{eq:glm-backoff} we devide the
sum of all backoff probabilities by their count.
The more backoff steps that have to be performed to reach a node, the lower its
influence is.
However in turn it also can be reached via more paths as seen in the backoff
graph of \cref{fig:history-glm}.
In total there exist two paths from the root node to any node in layer $2$.
But there exists a total of six paths from the root node to the node in layer
$3$.
We define a coefficient $\mu = \frac{(n - l)!}{n!}$, where $n$
is the length of the current history and $l$ is the layer in the backoff graph
in which its node occurs.
Sum weights $\SumWeight^h_i$ are also proportional to that coefficient $\mu$.

The final influence on $\SumWeight^h_{2 i - 1}$ stems from the fact that we
defined \cref{eq:glmarg-high} to only consist of the numerator of
\cref{eq:glm-high}.
Because of this we also have to devide the sum weight by the denominator of
that equotion.

Sum weights $\SumWeight^h_{2 i}$ for terms that occurs in lower orders are
calculated in a analogous way.
For the same argument as above they are also influenced by the coefficient
$\mu$ and a denominator, but this time that of \cref{eq:glm-low}.
However for lower order weights they are also influenced by the denominators
of equations that included them.
This fact is especially visible by the nesting of fractions in
\cref{eq:probglmexpansion-inserted}.
\todo{Additional explanation of $factor \cdot sum$ property.}

Because of the complexity of factors we will not try to find a mathematical
expression that defines these sum weights.
Instead we will find them by specifying the algorithm that computes them:
Sum weights $\SumWeight^h_i$ are calculated by \cref{alg:weightedsum-glm} which
uses the helper functions of \cref{alg:weightedsum-glm-helper}.
