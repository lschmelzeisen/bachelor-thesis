This chapter will show how to represent  $\ProbMKN{w_n}{w_1^{n-1}}$ and
$\ProbGLM{w_n}{w_1^{n-1}}$ as weighted sums of terms depending on $w_n$ for a
fixed history $h = w_1^{n-1}$ and an  arbitrary argument $w = w_n$.
In other words we will express the formulas given in \cref{ch:review-lm} as
equations of the following form:
\begin{equation}
  \Prob{w}{h} = \sum_{i = 1}^{N} \SumWeight_i^h \cdot \SumArg_i^h(w_n)
\end{equation}

Using this it is possible to calculate queries of type ``Noisy Channel Argmax''
(\cref{eq:noisychannel}) much more efficiently, as it is possible to perform the
(potentially expensive) calculation of $\SumWeight_i^h$ in advance.
To compute every $\Prob{w}{h}$ we now just have to calculate the
$\SumArg_i^h(w)$.

Another benefit of this representation is that it is a prerequisite of Top-$k$
joining to supply a monotone scoring function, which only depends on the
joined arguments.
Weighted sums are trivially monotone \todo{really?} and we will be able to
select our join arguments to exactly match $\SumArg_i^h$.
In addition further optimized top-$k$ joining algorithms exists, that require
weighted sum scoring functions.
However we will not use these algorithms in this work.
For a detailed discussion see \cref{ch:top-k-joining}.

In the case of Generalized Language Models our solution will also have a
considerably better computational complexity to calculate probabilities than the
na{\"\i}ve approach of just computing the formulas given in
\cref{sec:review-lm-glm}.
\begin{draft}
This will counter biggest disadvantage of GLM.
\end{draft}

We will now present the basic idea of how to transform $\Prob{w_n}{w_1^{n-1}}$
into weighted sums, that applies to both Modified Kneser-Ney Smoothing and
the Generalized Language Model as well:

Note that in all \cref{eq:mkn-high,eq:mkn-low,eq:glm-high,eq:glm-low} the
probability event $w_n$ only appears in the argument terms of
$\DiscountedCount$ or $\DiscountedCount*$.
Additionally $w_n$ occurs as arguments for $\Count$ and $\ContCountIp$ in the
lowest order \cref{eq:mkn-lowest,eq:glm-lowest}.

Our general idea is thus, to first expand recursive calls to
$\Prob(\DummyArg)$ or $\Prob*(\DummyArg)$, and second to factor
out those terms that do not depend on $w_n$ by the distributive property.
Examples of this idea are given in \cref{app:expansion}.
However they assume the history to be seen in training.
Forfeiting this assumption will add considerable complexity in the case
of Generalized Language Models.

\section{Modified Kneser-Ney Smoothing}

Modified Kneser-Ney Smoothed probabilities $\ProbMKN{w}{h}$ are calculated as
follows:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Backing-off: Leave out words at the beginning of the history $h$, until
    $h \Skp$ is seen for the first time (\cref{eq:mkn-backoff}).
  \item Highest order: Take frequency counts $\DiscountedCount(h \: w)$ and
    $\Count(h \Skp)$ (\cref{eq:mkn-high}) and shorten the history by one word.
  \item Lower orders: Take continuation counts $\DiscountedCount*(\WSkp h \: w)$
    and $\ContCountIp(\WSkp h \WSkp)$ (\cref{eq:mkn-low}) and shorten the
    history further until it is empty.
  \item Lowest order: Take continuation counts $\ContCountIp(\WSkp w)$ and
    $\ContCountIp(\WSkp \WSkp)$ (\cref{eq:mkn-lowest}).
\end{enumerate}
All counts except those of the lowest order are discounted using
$\DiscountedCount$ and $\DiscountedCount*$ to interpolate that order with the
following by the weight $\gamma(h)$.
This process of interpolation different orders is visualized in
\cref{fig:history-mkn}.

  %  back-off is necessary.}
  \label{fig:history-mkn}
\end{figure}

The first step in expressing $\ProbMKN{w}{h}$ as a weighted sum is finding the
number $N$ of sum weights.
In the case of Modified Kneser-Ney Smoothing this is exactly the number of
interpolation orders.
Let $\SeenHistory$ be the first seen history that may be the result of backing
off given history $h$ a number of times.
The number $N$ of sum weights is then the number of words in the first seen
history $\SeenHistory$ plus one.
\begin{equation}
  N = \StringLength{\SeenHistory} + 1
\end{equation}

The next step is to find the actual terms $\SumArg_i^h(w)$ that shall be
weighted added.
When looking at the equations that define Modified Kneser-Ney we note the fact
that only the count terms in the numerators depend on the probability event $w$.
Exactly these terms compose our sum arguments:
\begin{equation}
  \SumArg_i^h(w) =
    \begin{dcases*}
      \Count(w)                                              & if $N = 1$ \\
      \DiscountedCount(\SeenHistory \: w)                    & if $N \neq 1 \land i = 1$ \\
      \DiscountedCount*(\WSkp \History_i(\SeenHistory) \: w) & if $N \neq 1 \land 1 < i < N$ \\
      \ContCountIp(\WSkp w)                                  & if $N \neq 1 \land i = N$
    \end{dcases*}
\end{equation}
Where $\History_i(w_1^n) = w_i^n$ is a helper mapping that gives the history
of the $i$th interpolation order.

Lastly we need to define the actual sum weights $\SumWeight_i^h$.
We note that --- because each order is interpolated with the weight $\gamma$ of
the previous order --- each order is in total weighted by the product of the
$\gamma$s of all previous orders.
Additionally lower order models occur occur in numerators, because of that we
the are also weighted by all previous denominator counts.
Building on this we can define:
\begin{equation}
  \SumWeight_i^h = \frac{\prod_{j = 1}^{i - 1} \gamma(\History_j(\SeenHistory))}
                        {\Count(\SeenHistory \Skp) \prod_{k = 2}^{i} \ContCountIp(\WSkp \History_k(\SeenHistory) \WSkp)}
\end{equation}
\todo[inline]{Or better recursively? Or alternatively?}
\begin{equation}
  \SumWeight_i^h = \frac{1}{\Count(\SeenHistory \Skp)} \prod_{j = 2}^i \frac{\gamma(\History_{j-1}(\SeenHistory))}{\ContCountIp(\WSkp \History_j(\SeenHistory) \WSkp)}
\end{equation}

\todo[inline]{Do we prove that this is actually MKN?}

Specifying an algorithm to compute interpolation weights $\SumWeight_i^h$ that
minimizes frequency count lookup (using the iterative definition of
$\SumWeight_i^h$) is straightforward and given in \cref{alg:weightedsum-mkn}.
\todo{Do we actually show this algorithm, as it is rather simple?}

\section{Generalized Language Model}

The Generalized Language Models interpolates with lower orders differently
than Modified Kneser-Ney, as described in \cref{sec:review-lm-glm}.
This section will only consider the definition of the skip operator
$\partial$ that we use in practice.
That is, $\partial_j(w_1^{n-1})$ replaces the $j$th non-skip word with a skip.
\begin{draft}
The  case of an arbitrary $\partial$ would be to complex.
\end{draft}

The case of Generalized Language Models is related to the Modified-Kneser Ney
case, although much more complex.
