Key-contribution is weighted sum representation of GLM.

Possibility to improve Argmax using Quick-Combine \parencite{Guentzer2000} and
Stream-Combine \parencite{Guentzer2001}.

Advanced top-k algorithms that optimized on a fixed history $h$ might be called
for if one wants to learn sum weights $\SumWeight$.

Other Noisy Channel Tasks might not fit the equi-join and require more
sophisticated Argmax algorithms (see \parencite{Ilyas2004}).
