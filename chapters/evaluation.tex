\chapter{Evaluation}

\begin{draft}
GLMTK by me was used for evaluation.

Experiment with runtime of $\ProbGLM{w_n}{w_1^{n-1}}$ from $n=1$ to some upper
bound to showcase complexity improvement of weighted sum to na{\"\i}ve,
recursive approach.

Experiment with top-k join algorithm vs stupid weighted sum argmax, to showcase
runtime improvement of top-k join.
