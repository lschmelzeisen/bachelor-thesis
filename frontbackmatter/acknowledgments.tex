First and foremost, I want to express my sincerest gratitude to my advisor,
Ren{\'e} Pickhardt, for suggesting the subject of this thesis, for his guidance
during my research, and for our long, fruitful discussions.
He is responsible for recognizing the problematic recursion of the Generalized
Language Model and for the original idea of using top-$k$ joining techniques.

Next, I thank my advisor, Steffen Staab, for the possibility of writing this
thesis and his feedback on its contents and on my writing.

I wish to further acknowledge Andrea Mildes, Thomas Krohmann,
Sebastian Schlicht and Frederik Unger for the act proof-reading this thesis.

Finally, I am grateful to my family for their constant support and encouragement
throughout my study.
