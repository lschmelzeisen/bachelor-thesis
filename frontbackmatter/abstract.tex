      The concern of this thesis is solving noisy channel type queries that are based
      on statistical language model probabilities.
      Our novel approach is to formulate language models as weighted sum functions on
      occurrence counts.
      As these weighted sum functions are monotone, we can then employ various
      top-$k$ joining techniques, to efficiently find those arguments that maximize
      the noisy channel's probability.
      This approach can be used for all noisy channel type queries, that can be
      expressed as monotone scoring functions.
      We will present our method by implementing next word prediction with it.
