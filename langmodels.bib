A basis for such a theory is contained in the important papers of Nyquist1 and Hartley2 on this subject. In the present paper we will extend the theory to include a number of new factors, in particular the effect of noise in the channel, and the savings possible due to the statistical structure of the original message and due to the nature of the final destination of the information.},

@article{Fagin2001,
  abstract = {Assume that each object in a database has m grades, or scores, one for each of m attributes. For example, an object can have a color grade, that tells how red it is, and a shape grade, that tells how round it is. For each attribute, there is a sorted list, which lists each object and its grade under that attribute, sorted by grade (highest grade first). Each object is assigned an overall grade, that is obtained by combining the attribute grades using a fixed monotone aggregation function, or combining rule, such as min or average. To determine the top k objects, that is, k objects with the highest overall grades, the naive algorithm must access every object in the database, to find its grade under each attribute. Fagin has given an algorithm (“Fagin's Algorithm”, or FA) that is much more efficient. For some monotone aggregation functions, \{FA\} is optimal with high probability in the worst case. We analyze an elegant and remarkably simple algorithm (“the threshold algorithm”, or TA) that is optimal in a much stronger sense than FA. We show that \{TA\} is essentially optimal, not just for some monotone aggregation functions, but for all of them, and not just in a high-probability worst-case sense, but over every database. Unlike FA, which requires large buffers (whose size may grow unboundedly as the database size grows), \{TA\} requires only a small, constant-size buffer. \{TA\} allows early stopping, which yields, in a precise sense, an approximate version of the top k answers. We distinguish two types of access: sorted access (where the middleware system obtains the grade of an object in some sorted list by proceeding through the list sequentially from the top), and random access (where the middleware system requests the grade of object in a list, and obtains it in one step). We consider the scenarios where random access is either impossible, or expensive relative to sorted access, and provide algorithms that are essentially optimal for these cases as well.},
